# How to contribute

Contribution should be done in a separate branch. Create a pull request to the `develop` branch.

Pull requests merged to `develop` are then merged into master, tagged, and released on Github (see [releases](https://github.com/geo-frontend/nlmaps/releases)) and [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/@geo-frontend/nlmaps).
